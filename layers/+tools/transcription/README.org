* Description
This layer adds support for transcription-mode
package. I've tried to use transcribe with emms, but moving jumping forwards and
backwards in audio caused the audio file to start from beginning. It is buggy so
I decided to try this package which is not covered in melpa.

The gist of the mode is to be able to precisely control media playback
while in a buffer containing that media's transcription. The main use
case is to rewind the video by a few second in order to re-listen to a
few words so they can be typed into the buffer, or corrected. It uses
VideoLAN's console interface to drive playback from within Emacs.

1. Open the transcription file.
2. Start the `transcription-mode` minor mode.
3. `M-x transcription-start` to select a media file to play.
4. Use the minor mode's keybindings to pause/play and seek.

** Features:
  - Transcription-mode


* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =transcription= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Key bindings

| Key Binding | Description                |
|-------------+----------------------------|
| ~SPC x x x~ | Does thing01               |
| ~C-c C-c~   | Pause/play the media.      |
| ~C-c s~     | Move backwards 3 seconds.  |
| ~C-c S~     | Move forwards 3 seconds.   |
| ~C-c t~     | Move backwards 10 seconds. |
| ~C-c T~     | Move forwards 10 seconds.  |
| ~C-c m~     | Move backwards 1 minute.   |
| ~C-c M~     | Move forwards 1 minute.    |
|-------------+----------------------------|

The media will still pop up in a VideoLAN window, so if you need to
make less common adjustments (playback speed, precise seeks, etc.) you
can switch focus and do it directly in VLC. The keybindings are for
frequent media control, like skipping back and forth by a few seconds.
